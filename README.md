# Overview

I want to know as many languages as I can to make communicating with other engineers easier. Java is a widely used language (understatement) that I need to have at least some experience in. This is my exercise for learning the basics of Java.

This is a simple digital randomizer that simulates rolling dice and comparing the results between two rolls.

I wanted to learn Java but I also love board games. I don't really have any interest in making video games (which everyone seems to think young programmers dream about) but I do like board games. They use dice a lot and this is something I knew well enough mathematically to program. The purpose was to learn Java and explore how useful it can be in assisting my hobbies.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code to accomplish everything in this program.

This program was an exercise in Java. I also used the HashMap (equal to Python's dictionaries) and the Scanner (equal to Python's input) classes from the Java.utils library.

# Future Work

* The error handling is very inelegant at this stage. It should be improved to better serve the user.
* This is only minimally useful for it's stated purpose. I think I will reimagine it to roll dice with any number of sides as the user wishes or store more data about the player and the enemy (such as health).
* This program is not at all fair to the goblin. I think I should program in a turn for them too.
